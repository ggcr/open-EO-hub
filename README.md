## About
This tool was made by Cristian Gutiérrez as part of its Final Bachelors Thesis @ Computer Vision Center at UAB. You can always open an issue into our GitHub Repository or send a mail to ggcristian@icloud.com and I'll get back to you as soon as we can.

### What is it?

This a multi-source API client for open-access and free Earth Obserbational Data. As time goes on we will add new features as well as new providers according to our needs. It is implemented with React. We do the user authentication behind the scenes for you so that the download of data is 1 click away from your browser!

### Multiple Data Providers

At the moment we are getting data from Element 84 open STAC API in which we can access Sentinel S2A Cloud Optimized. And the brand new Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem API from the European Space Agency (ESA) in which we can access Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3, Sentinel 5P, Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 data.
